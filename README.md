# PySmiley
A Python script that generates a smiley face using pure code libraries of Python. No external tools or software required. The script creates a new image with a white background, a yellow circle for the face, black circles for the eyes, and a red arc for the mouth.
And if you want you can also add an Emoji...just like I did :)
